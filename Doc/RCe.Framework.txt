1. Documentation: RCe.FrameWork; 
1.1. RCe.FrameWork, exists  as a philosofy of naming variables plus VectorKIM. No more tools. RCe means "Get Remote Control",  
      so, then it is needed, afterlook your code or process it automatically, if it was written with understanding the  RCe.FrameWork.

      You could see: Every variable that could be attacked to get RCE, looks like: $_strVariable1, $_intIntegerX, 
      $_arr('_strStrinD','_intIntegerH'). The common of this variables is "$_[var_type]".  While processing your programm as a txt file, 
      i mean as a source code, replace "$_[var_type]" with a variable filter by type function. So, in most cases, everything will be ok.
      So have a good day :)
